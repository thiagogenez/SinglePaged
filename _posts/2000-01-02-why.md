## Project Vision

Legacy hardware middleboxes has shown that joint optimisation of VMs and policy rules can significantly mitigate link utilisation at the core and aggregation layers of data centre networks by 90% and 28% respectively while at the same time adhering strictly to policy require dments

SYNC leverage the synergy amongst policy **rules**, **applications** and the underlying temporal **network state** for achieving network-wide performance optimisation.

SYNC takes  in high-level **network policy expressions** and implement them in network function boxes at different network locations, be they the *middleboxes*, *network switches*, or *end hosts*, using a minimum set of network-wide consistent policy rules.

-------------------------

## Innovative Claims

- SYNC exploits the underlying network state to arrange application virtual machines so that the network-wide impact of pairwise traffic patterns is minimised while still adhering strictly to network policies. 
- SYNC will continuously optimise both application and network performance by dynamically reallocating both applications and policy rules according to temporal network load amongst applications.


-------------------------

## Major Challenges

The existing body of work for managing network policies has failed to tackle aforementioned challenges as it has focused primarily on ensuring the correctness of high-level policy, or has been limited to managing them in only one domain of network function boxes

The correct implementation of network policies in todayâ€™s cloud data centres still face the following challenges:

- Independent tenants constantly impose contradicting networking objectives onto physical networks;
- Dynamic virtual machine (VM) consolidation means both flow state and the mapping state of IPs must be updated across the network; 
- Rapid change of the application life-cycle means frequent change to governing policies as well as network-wide temporal traffic load;
- SDN and NFV have resulted in a greater number of independent entities that dynamically generate and implement rules, respectively.
